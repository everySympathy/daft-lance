    ``lance_ds`` is the driver's live dataset (planning, validation, commits);
    ``open_context`` is the serializable handle workers reopen from and the
    single source of uri, storage options and namespace kwargs.

    Every supported index type is built with the distributed segment-index
    workflow: each worker builds a fully independent index segment with
    ``create_index_uncommitted``, and the coordinator commits them atomically
    with ``commit_existing_index_segments``, which records complete index
    metadata (no more empty ``index_details``). ``FTS`` is normalized to
    ``INVERTED`` (same Lance index).

    ``replace=True`` (the default) relies on Lance core's atomic overlap
    replacement: ``commit_existing_index_segments`` removes committed segments
    whose fragments overlap the incoming ones in the same CreateIndex
    transaction, so a full-coverage rebuild swaps the old index in one
    transaction. ``replace=False`` refuses to touch an existing index; the
    default matches pylance's own ``replace`` default. Types without a distributed
    path raise ``ValueError`` instead of silently falling back to single-node
    Lance indexing — callers wanting single-node execution should call pylance
    directly.

    ``fragment_ids`` restricts the build to a subset of the dataset's
    fragments. When the named index already exists, already-covered fragments
    are skipped and only the remaining ones are built and appended; untouched
    committed segments are preserved. This is the incremental backfill path
    for newly appended fragments. Column/type compatibility of a same-name
